# Week 5 – Day 2  
# System Prompt vs User Prompt (Super Easy Mode)

---

## 🎯 Goal
Understand who controls AI behavior and how companies make AI predictable and safe.

---

---

## 🧠 Imagine This

AI is a new employee.

Two people talk to this employee:

1. Boss 👔  
2. Customer 🧑‍💼  

Who has more power?

👉 The boss.

---

---

## 🧠 Translation to AI

👔 Boss = System Prompt  
🧑‍💼 Customer = User Prompt  

System rules always win.

---

---

## 🧠 What is a System Prompt?

System prompt tells AI:

- how to behave  
- personality  
- rules  
- boundaries  
- what is allowed  
- what is forbidden  

It is permanent and hidden from the user.

---

### Example System Prompt

```bash
You are a polite support agent.
Keep answers short.
If unsure, say you don't know.
```

Every response must follow this.

---

---

## 🧠 What is a User Prompt?

User prompt is simply what the customer asks.

Example:

```bash
Where is my order?
```

---

---

## 🧠 What Happens Internally

AI processes:

```bash
System Rules + User Question = Final Answer
```

---

---

## 🧠 What if They Conflict?

System says:
```bash
Never guess.
```

User says:
```bash
Guess my delivery date.
```

AI follows system → it refuses.

---

---

## 🧠 Why Companies Depend on System Prompts

Because they want AI to be:

```bash
✅ safe  
✅ consistent  
✅ predictable  
✅ aligned with brand  
✅ legally careful  

Without this → chaos.
```
---

---

## 🧠 Without System Prompt

User:
```bash
Explain loans.
```

AI:
```bash
maybe long  
maybe complex  
maybe risky  
```

Uncontrolled.

---

---

## 🧠 With System Prompt

System:

```bash
Explain financial topics in simple language.
Maximum 3 lines.
```

User:
```bash
Explain loans.
```

Now output is controlled.

---

---

## 🧠 Big Insight

System prompt converts:

```bash
General AI → Company Product
```

---

---

## 🧠 Real Production Thinking

```bash
System = company brain
User = request
AI = worker
```

---

---

## 🧠 What System Prompts Typically Control

### Tone
polite / friendly / professional

### Length
short / detailed / bullet points

### Risk
don’t guess / avoid diagnosis / no guarantees

### Audience
beginner / developer / expert

---

---

## 🧠 Example from Real Life

System:

```bash
You are an HR assistant.
Never provide salary predictions.
```

User:
```bash
What salary will I get?
```

AI must refuse.

---

---

## 🧠 Why AI Engineers Must Master This

You are responsible for:

- behavior  
- trust  
- safety  
- product reliability  

---

---

## 🧠 Golden Memory Line

```bash
System decides HOW.
User decides WHAT.
```

---

---

## 🧪 Brain Practice

User asks:
```bash
How should I invest?
```

As a company, system rules might be:

- general education only  
- no guarantees  
- encourage professional advice  

That is system design.

---

---

## 🧠 Beginner vs Engineer Thinking

Beginner:
**Focus only on question.**

Engineer:
**Designs permanent behavior rules.**

---

---

## ✅ Day Complete When You Understand

- ✔ system is boss  
- ✔ user is request  
- ✔ system cannot be overridden  
- ✔ system creates consistency
