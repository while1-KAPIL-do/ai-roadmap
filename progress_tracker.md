# ================================
# PHASE 1 — PYTHON & ENGINEERING FOUNDATIONS
# ================================

## Week 1 – Python Data Structures
[ ] Day 1 – Lists  
[ ] Day 2 – Tuples  
[ ] Day 3 – Sets  
[ ] Day 4 – Dictionaries  
[ ] Day 5 – Practice & mini problems  

---

## Week 2 – Files, JSON & Data Handling
[ ] Day 1 – File read/write  
[ ] Day 2 – JSON basics  
[ ] Day 3 – JSON + files  
[ ] Day 4 – Transforming data  
[ ] Day 5 – Practice scenarios  

---

## Week 3 – APIs & HTTP
[ ] Day 1 – Requests & GET  
[ ] Day 2 – Error handling  
[ ] Day 3 – Payload building  
[ ] Day 4 – POST requests  
[ ] Day 5 – End-to-end mini flow  


## While learning JSON, files, APIs → always think:
- ✔ how will Laravel send data here?
- ✔ how will response come back?
- ✔ what can fail?
- ✔ how to log?

# ================================
# PHASE 2 — GIT & PROFESSIONAL WORKFLOW
# ================================

## Week 4 – Git
[ ] Day 1 – Git basics  
[ ] Day 2 – Writing strong commits  
[ ] Day 3 – Branching  
[ ] Day 4 – Pull requests  
[ ] Day 5 – Syncing & cleanup  

## Don’t treat this basic. Start acting like:
- ✔ team contributor
- ✔ writing clean PRs
- ✔ documenting changes

---

# ================================
# PHASE 3 — PROMPT ENGINEERING
# ================================

## Week 5 – Prompt Foundations
[ ] Day 1 – Prompt basics & control  
[ ] Day 2 – System vs user prompts  
[ ] Day 3 – Few-shot prompting  
[ ] Day 4 – Output structuring  
[ ] Day 5 – Prompt reliability patterns  

### You should think:
- ✔ how to make output deterministic
- ✔ how to avoid hallucination
- ✔ how to validate before saving in DB

---

---

# ================================
# PHASE 4 — LLM INTEGRATION
# ================================

## Week 6 – Working with Models
[ ] Day 1 – Calling LLM APIs  
[ ] Day 2 – Handling responses  
[ ] Day 3 – JSON outputs  
[ ] Day 4 – Token awareness  
[ ] Day 5 – Cost & reliability  

## Ask:
- ✔ what if API fails?
- ✔ timeout?
- ✔ partial response?
- ✔ cost explosion?

Add guards.
Boom → senior vibes.

# ================================
# PHASE 5 — AI SYSTEM DESIGN
# ================================

## Week 7 – Pipelines
[ ] Day 1 – Prompt chaining  
[ ] Day 2 – Validation layers  
[ ] Day 3 – Retry & fallbacks  
[ ] Day 4 – Observability  
[ ] Day 5 – System flow design  

## You now think:
- ✔ retries
- ✔ fallbacks
- ✔ monitoring
- ✔ human override
- ✔ metrics

This is how real companies operate.

# ================================
# PHASE 6 — RAG & KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS
# ================================

## Week 8
[ ] Day 1 – Embeddings  
[ ] Day 2 – Chunking  
[ ] Day 3 – Vector databases  
[ ] Day 4 – Retrieval  
[ ] Day 5 – Full RAG pipeline  

## Most people stop at “it works”. You should think:
- ✔ how to re-index?
- ✔ access control?
- ✔ stale data?
- ✔ latency?

🔥 recruiters love this.

# ================================
# PHASE 7 — AGENTS & TOOL USE
# ================================

## Week 9
[ ] Day 1 – What is an agent  
[ ] Day 2 – Tool calling  
[ ] Day 3 – Multi-step reasoning  
[ ] Day 4 – Action execution  
[ ] Day 5 – Agent workflows  

## Instead of cool demos, ask:
- ✔ how to stop infinite loops
- ✔ who approves actions
- ✔ audit logs

Now you are enterprise-ready.

---

# ================================
# PHASE 8 — PORTFOLIO & JOB READINESS
# ================================

## Week 10
[ ] Day 1 – Project selection  
[ ] Day 2 – Architecture clarity  
[ ] Day 3 – Documentation

## convert everything into:
- ✔ business language
- ✔ impact
- ✔ scale
- ✔ reliability
This gets calls!

# 🚀 Personal Rule

- No skipping.  
- No rushing.  
- Consistency > speed.
- Every tick = closer to AI Engineering

# 🎯 One golden rule I want you to add

While learning ANYTHING, always ask:

**“If 10,000 users use this tomorrow, what breaks?”**
